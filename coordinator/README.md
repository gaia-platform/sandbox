# Gaia Sandbox Coordinator
A Gaia application to coordinate launching of and interacting with containerized Gaia template applications launched through AWS ECS and communicating using MQTT.

# Sandbox Coordinator development setup
## Prerequisites
You'll need to

* Install Gaia
* Install aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp

### Installing Gaia
Follow instructions [here](https://gaia-platform.github.io/gaia-platform-docs.io/articles/getting-started-with-gaia.html) to install Gaia.

### Installing aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp
From inside the root sandbox directory clone the [aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2) and build using clang. May also work with gcc but so far only tested with clang.
```bash
export CC=/usr/bin/clang-10
export CPP=/usr/bin/clang-cpp-10
export CXX=/usr/bin/clang++-10
export LDFLAGS=-fuse-ld=lld-10
cd {coordinator_directory}
git clone --recursive https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2.git
cd aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

## Install AWS IoT certificates
* [Create a certificate](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home?region=us-west-2#/thing/sandbox_coordinator) for the `sandbox_coordinator` Thing and attach the certificate to the certificate to the SandboxCoordinator Policy: arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:794670594658:policy/SandboxCoordinator.
* Download the new certificate, private key, and Amazon root CA1 certificate.
* Create a new folder named `certs` in your coordinator directory and copy the downloaded files there.
* Rename the certificate and private key respectively to: `coordinator-certificate.pem.crt` and `coordinator-private.pem.key`
* Leave the Amazon root certificate name unchanged, namely: `AmazonRootCA1.pem`

## Build Sandbox Coordinator
Create build directory within coordinator directory, run cmake and then make.
```bash
cd {coordinator_directory}
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Run the Coordinator
When developing and/or testing the coordinator, set the environment variable COORDINATOR_NAME to a globally unique name for your instance of the coordinator. In production (and only in production) the COORDINATOR_NAME value must be set to `sandbox_coordinator`.
```bash
export COORDINATOR_NAME=<your chosen coordinator name>
```
Then run the coordinator
```bash
./coordinator
```

## Run the Sandbox web server
Follow this repository's [README](../README.md) instructions to install and launch the sandbox front-end/UI specifying the coordinator name you used above when launching it.
